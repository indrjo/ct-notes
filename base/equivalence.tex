Let us give a definition that will motivate our discourse.

\begin{definition}[Full- and faithfulness]
  A functor \(F : \cat C \to \cat D\) is said {\em full}, respectively
  {\em faithful}, whenever for every \(a, b \in \obj{\cat C}\) the
  functions
  \[F : \cat C (a, b) \to \cat D(F(a), F(b))\] are surjective,
  respectively injective; we say that \(F\) is {\em fully faithful}
  \NotaInterna{how lame, lol\dots{}} whenever it is both full and
  faithful.
\end{definition}

What do we want \q{two categories are the same} to mean?
\NotaInterna{Craft a nicer exposition\dots{} Let us try with
  categories being isomorphic first, and then with {\em essentially
    surjective} functors. Talk about {\em skeletons} of categories,
  and how can help to say whether two categories are equivalent.}

\begin{example}[A functor \(\Mat_k \to \FDVect_k\)]\label{example:MatrixFunctor}
  For \(k\) field, consider the functor
  \[M : \Mat_k \to \FDVect_k\] that maps
  \(n \in \obj{\Mat_k} = \naturals\) to \(M(n) \coloneq k^n\) and
  \(A \in \Mat_k(r, s)\) to the linear function
  \[\begin{aligned}
    & M_A : k^r \to k^s \\
    & M_A(x) = Ax .
  \end{aligned}\]
(Here the elements of \(k^n\) are matrices of type \(n \times 1\).) \NotaInterna{\dots{}} % We shall return to such functor soon.
\end{example}

% \begin{example}[Linear functions can be encoded into matrices]
%   Recall Example~\ref{example:MatrixFunctor}. \NotaInterna{Ok, let
%   us try this and see what is the result\dots{} Anyway, there will
%   be another occasion to deal with equivalences of categories, in
%   another fashion.}
